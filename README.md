nltk (Natural Language Toolkit):nltk is a powerful library for natural language processing tasks. It offers tools for tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and more. With nltk, you can preprocess user input, extract key information, analyze sentiment, and generate responses that are more contextually relevant and natural-sounding.

random: The random module provides functions for generating random numbers, which can be useful for tasks like shuffling data or creating random samples.

string: The string module contains a collection of string constants and utility functions for working with strings, such as character sets (like ASCII letters or digits).

sklearn (scikit-learn): This is a popular machine learning library that includes tools for various tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and preprocessing. In this case, you're importing modules related to text processing (CountVectorizer for converting text documents into numerical feature vectors) and similarity computation (cosine_similarity for computing the cosine similarity between vectors).

numpy: This library provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently.
